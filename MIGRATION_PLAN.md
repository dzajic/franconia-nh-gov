# Migration & Redesign Plan

## 1. Goals

* Create a modern, reliable town website that is easy to maintain
* Preserve *all* existing content (no loss during migration)
* Improve accessibility, navigation, and mobile usability
* Ensure long-term town ownership and transparency

## 2. Migration Approach (Content First, No Disruption)

* Migrate existing pages and documents page-for-page into the new system
* Keep the current site live until the new site is reviewed and approved
* Preserve public URLs where possible; add clean redirects where needed
* Validate content accuracy with boards and departments

## 3. Redesign Scope (Practical, Not Flashy)

* Clean, readable layout focused on clarity
* Simple navigation for boards, departments, and documents
* Accessibility-aware fonts, contrast, and structure
* Works well on phones, tablets, and desktops

## 4. Tools, Hosting, and Transparency

* Site source, history, and changes tracked in GitHub
* Free or very low-cost hosting
* Full version history with the ability to roll back changes
* No vendor lock-in

## 5. Admin & Content Editor Training

* Short training sessions for administrators and content editors
* Simple workflow: edit → preview → publish
* Written guides for common tasks:

  * Posting meeting minutes
  * Updating pages
  * Uploading and linking PDFs
* Training materials stored with the project for future staff and volunteers

## 6. Working Group → Technology Committee

* Establish a small working group (3–5 people):

  * Town staff
  * Board or committee representatives
  * Technical support
* Initial focus: website migration and redesign review
* Long-term evolution into a standing Technology Committee to:

  * Oversee the website
  * Support future digital tools and services
  * Maintain continuity and institutional knowledge

## 7. Timeline (Flexible, Town-Driven)

* Overall timeline: up to ~1 year
* Can move faster or slower depending on availability and priorities
* Suggested phases:

  * Early phase: content migration and structure
  * Middle phase: design refinement and accessibility review
  * Later phase: training, review, and public launch

## 8. Cost, Risk, and Ownership

* Minimal direct cost (tools and hosting are free or low-cost)
* No downtime during transition
* Town retains full ownership of content, code, and infrastructure
* Reduces long-term dependency on outside vendors
