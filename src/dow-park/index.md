Dow Park is eight acres of open greenway, with 1685 feet of river frontage with a path along the water.&nbsp; Within the park is one 45,000 sq. ft athletic field and two 25,000 sq. ft athletic fields, a playground for ages 3-12, 12’x 20’ gazebo and a 30'x60' pavilion..&nbsp; There is electricity servicing several areas in the park.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
The land was donated to the town in 1990 by Darald and Juliet Libby.&nbsp; The construction of the fields, playground, and gazebo were all paid for with donations, fundraisers, and a grant from the LWCF program.  
  
The town park operating budget pays for the mowing, fertilizing, gardening, electricity and portable toilets.
