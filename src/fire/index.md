*********************************************************  
A quick reminder for all residents and home owners. If you own a home in Franconia that has a monitored fire alarm system you are strongly encouraged to purchase a Knox box key holder. This is even more important if your home is a secondary residence. A Knox box is a secured key box that is mounted to your home which only the fire department has access to in an emergency.

Winter Brings many challenges. Be prepared, have your chimney inspected by a professional. Be careful with space heaters. Never leave a motor running in a garage: car, generator, etc.  
  
Be safe...this could be the crew that shows up to save the day!

It takes a special person to fill the boots of a volunteer firefighter.  
Someone with a desire to do something important for the community.  
Someone with courage and dedication, who isn't afraid of hard work, and is willing to accept the challenge of a difficult job.  
  
It takes a person who considers respect and appreciation reward enough, and who is just glad to help.  
  
If you're this kind of person, you're needed as a volunteer fire fighter.  
  
Come down to the fire station and talk to us. We might be able to fit you with a pair of boots!

To use your extinguisher, remember "P.A.S.S."  
  
**Pull** the pin that unlocks the lever.  
  
**Aim** low, pointing the extinguisher nozzle at the base of the fire  
  
**Squeeze** the lever above the handle to discharge the agent.  
  
**Sweep** the nozzle from side to side. Move carefully toward the flames, keep the nozzle aimed at the base of the fire, sweep back and forth.

Practice Fire Safety Everyday:  
Test Smoke Alarms regularly, replace batteries twice a year.  
  
 _Your Home Fire Safety Checklist/Fire Plan_ :  
Make sure all family members know what to do in the event of a fire.  
Draw a floor plan with at least two ways of escaping every room. Make a drawing for each floor. Make sure the plan shows important details: stairs, hallways and windows that can be used as fire escape routes. Test windows and doors—do they open easy enough? Are they wide enough? Or tall enough?  
Choose a safe meeting place outside the house.Practice alerting other members.
