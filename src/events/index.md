**On Thursday, August 7th from 6-7pm, join NH Recycles for a Recycling 101 presentation at the Lafayette School********in Franconia, NH.** Have you ever wondered what happens to that aluminum can once you throw it in the recycling bin? What makes recycling different in New Hampshire compared to our neighboring states? Join NH Recycles to get answers to your burning recycling questions at our upcoming Recycling 101 presentation and Q&A session. Bring your friends and neighbors to learn what steps we can all take to make a difference. Thanks to support from an EPA grant, this event is FREE for all; registration is requested.  _Thank you to the Tri-Town Transfer Station Committee - specifically the towns of Easton, Sugarhill, and Franconia - as well as the Ammonoosuc Conservation Trust for inviting NH Recycles to share this presentation!_
