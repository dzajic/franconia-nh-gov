​A lot purchase does not give ownership, but grants the right to be buried. Lots purchased are for human burial purposes only. Lots may not be transferred, assigned or conveyed to others, and can only be sold back to the Town of Franconia for the original purchase price. Cornerstones are required for each lot, will be installed as soon as possible after lot purchase, and are to be flush with the ground. Headstones cannot exceed 40” in height.  
A concrete vault is required for traditional burials. No tombs allowed.  
  
The Franconia Sexton, or a person designated by the Cemetery Trustees, must be on site for all burials and for all gravestone installations.
