Charles H Greenleaf presented the library to the town in 1912 and named it in honor of his wife Abbie.  
Colonel Greenleaf owned the Profile House, a grand hotel in Franconia Notch. The Greenleaf Trail and hut on Mount Lafayette are named after him.  
  
&nbsp;The library is of Jacobethan/Collegiate Gothic design with Richardsonian Romanesque features. Details include an oak door with bulls-eye glass, mosaic floors, mahogany woodwork, and stained glass.  
  
&nbsp;The building was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in July, 2003.
