**Fox Hill Park is 99 acres of woodlands, with 1430 feet of river frontage.&nbsp;There are four main trails for 3 miles  
of hiking, biking, cross country skiing and snowshoeing.&nbsp;  
There are several benches along the trails and a kiosk at the  
entrance.**  
  
**The land was donated to the town by&nbsp; John and Cynthia Coffin in 1990 and is protected under the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forest.&nbsp; [Find out more about the ski jump](http://www.franconianh.org/uploads/1/1/6/8/11680191/fox_hill_ski_jump.docx).**  
  
**The Friends of Profile Trails group donate their time and materials for trail maintenance and small bridge construction and in 2018 we received a $5000 grant from the NH Trails Bureau for trail maintenance.**  
  
**There is currently no operating budget for Fox Hill Park.**
