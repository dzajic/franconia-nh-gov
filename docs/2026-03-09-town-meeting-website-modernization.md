*Prepared as a volunteer effort to explore safer, simpler, and more sustainable ways to manage the town website and significantly reduce the amount of the proposed warrant to migration the website to a new platform.*

# 🙂 How this started (true story)

- I was already rebuilding the town website for fun
- My wife noticed a website budget item in the town meeting minutes
- Funny timing — but it showed the need was real

---

# 👋 Why I got involved

- I’m on the Energy Commission and already update our section of the site
- A shared admin login always concerned me
- I’m a software engineer with ~25 years of web experience

---

# 🧭 Why we’re here

- The town website needs long-term care
- This is public infrastructure
- Tool choice affects ownership

---

# 🛠️ What we’re deciding

- The *tool*, not the process
- Open formats, no lock-in
- Incremental and reversible

---

# 🧱 Why this approach

- Proven, boring web standards (HTML + files)
- Easier than ever to manage
- Local ownership and continuity

---

# 💸 Budget philosophy

- No licensing costs
- Small, visible stewardship budget (~$1k/year)
- Spend locally, scale only if needed

---

# 🍁 Bottom line

- Simple, durable, portable
- Community ownership by design
- A very New Hampshire solution

## Addendum: Optional Use of GitHub for Hosting & Management

As an option (not a requirement), the town could choose to use GitHub as part of the website setup.

**Potential benefits:**

- Full change history (who changed what, and when)
- Fine-grained permissions (no shared admin passwords)
- Easy rollback if something goes wrong
- No vendor lock-in; content remains simple files (Markdown + images)
- Free or very low-cost hosting via GitHub Pages

**Important note:**

GitHub is simply a management and hosting tool.  
The website itself remains standard HTML files, and could be moved elsewhere at any time if the town prefers.
