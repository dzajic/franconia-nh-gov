*This document reflects a volunteer-led exploration of practical, low-risk options to modernize and simplify the town website while keeping long-term costs and complexity low.*

# 🙂 How this started (true story)

- I was already rebuilding the town website for fun
- My wife noticed a website budget item in the town meeting minutes
- Funny timing — but it showed the need was real

---

# 👋 Why I got involved

- I’m on the Energy Commission and already update our section of the site
- A shared admin login always concerned me
- I’m a software engineer with ~25 years of web experience

---

# 🧭 Why we’re here

- The town website needs long-term care
- This is public infrastructure
- Tool choice affects ownership

---

# 🛠️ What we’re deciding

- The *tool*, not the process
- Open formats, no lock-in
- Incremental and reversible

---

# 🧱 Why this approach

- Proven, boring web standards (HTML + files)
- Easier than ever to manage
- Local ownership and continuity

---

# 💸 Budget philosophy

- No licensing costs
- Small, visible stewardship budget (~$1k/year)
- Spend locally, scale only if needed

---

# 🍁 Bottom line

- Simple, durable, portable
- Community ownership by design
- A very New Hampshire solution

## Addendum: Optional Use of GitHub for Hosting & Management

As an option (not a requirement), the town could choose to use GitHub as part of the website setup.

**Potential benefits:**

- Full change history (who changed what, and when)
- Fine-grained permissions (no shared admin passwords)
- Easy rollback if something goes wrong
- No vendor lock-in; content remains simple files (Markdown + images)
- Free or very low-cost hosting via GitHub Pages

**Important note:**

GitHub is simply a management and hosting tool.  
The website itself remains standard HTML files, and could be moved elsewhere at any time if the town prefers.

### Optional Future Workflow: “Email-to-Update” Submissions

To reduce friction for committee members, the town could adopt an optional workflow where updates are submitted by email, and automatically converted into a draft website change for review.

**How it could work:**
- Committee members email updates (text + attachments) to a dedicated address.
- An automated process creates a tracked draft change (a GitHub Pull Request).
- A designated approver reviews and publishes the change.

**Why this helps:**
- Email remains the day-to-day user experience for contributors.
- GitHub preserves the audit trail, change history, and rollback capability.
- Publishing remains permissioned and consistent.

**Note:** Email-based approval is also possible (e.g., reply “APPROVE” from an allowlisted sender), but could be treated as a later enhancement after the basic workflow is proven.
